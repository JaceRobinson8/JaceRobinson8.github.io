                I am currently a graduate research assistant in the <a href="http://knoesis.org/sites/default/files/people/derek/wacs/">Web and Complex Systems Lab</a> and <a href="http://knoesis.org/"> Kno.e.sis Research Center</a> in the <a href="https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/computer-science-and-engineering">computer science department</a> at <a href="https://www.wright.edu/">Wright State University</a>, working towards a Master's of Science in Computer Science under the advisement of <a href="http://knoesis.org/people/derek/">Dr. Derek Doran</a>. 

                I am fascinated with the notation of mapping mathematical and statistical ideas to real data with impact. Currently I am interested in combining ideas from machine learning, network science, and time series to tackle problems in complex systems. I will be pursuing a PhD with a focus in network science and machine learning starting Fall 2018.
                <br /> <br />

                I am actively looking for summer internship in data science or data analyst related positions for 2018! Feel encouraged to contact me at robinson.329@wright.edu with opportunities.

                <!-- During my undergraduate I was a research assistant for two years with <a href="http://people.wright.edu/k.arasu">Dr. K.T.

I was also a teaching assistant for a few undergraduate mathematics and computer science courses of Calculus I-II, Discrete Mathematics, and College Algebra.-->

                    Sociotechnological and geospatial processes exhibit time varying structure that make insight discovery challenging. This project proposes a new statistical model for such systems, modeled as dynamic networks, to address this challenge. It assumes that vertices fall into one of <i>k</i> types and that the probability of edge formation at a particular time depends on the types of the incident nodes and the current time. The time dependencies are driven by unique seasonal processes, which many systems exhibit (e.g., predictable spikes in geospatial or web traffic each day). The project defines the model as a generative process and an inference procedure to recover the seasonal processes from data when they are unknown.



                    <!--For this project we are developing a novel random network model which combines the tools of <i>Stochastic Block Models</i> with <i>State Space Models</i> in order to capture the <i>Seasonal Dynamics</i> of a large networks. An applied example is in the context of a geospatial network. Daily foot and vehicle traffic densities in a city fluctuate in predictable ways throughout the day. We can create a model of these predictable seasonal patterns and use them to define typical behavior for a geospace. Once a model for typical is created, it allows us to automatically detect when something atypical occurs within the geospace, which is often a more valuable question. -->

            <div class="grouper">
              In the past summer of 2017, I worked as an intern at the <a href=https://www.nasa.gov/hrp> National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center </a> with <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/debra-goodenow-4a014a1a/>Debra Goodenow</a> and <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-myers-6aa76715/>Jerry Myers</a>. I worked in the human research program to develop a dynamic probabilistic risk assessment tool to quantify the level of risk astronauts face from medical conditions in various mission scenarios.

            Iterative Closest Point for Automated Aerial Refueling
        </div>
        <div class="grouper">
            The Iterative Closest Point algorithm is a widely used approach to aligning the geometry between two 3 dimensional objects. The capability of aligning two geometries in real time on low-cost hardware will enable the creation of new applications in Computer Vision and Graphics such as automated aerial refueling between a tanker and jet. This work presents an accelerated alignment variant which utilizes parallelization on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) of multiple kNN approaches augmented with a novel Delaunay Traversal to achieve real time estimates.

            Nonlinear Optimization with Confidence Visualization for Tracking Passive Objects
        </div>
        <div class="grouper">
         Angle of Arrival (AOA) measurements can be created from any sensor platform with any sort of optical sensor, location and attitude knowledge to track passive objects. Previous work has created a non-linear optimization (NLO) method for calculating the most likely estimate from AOA measurements. Two new modifications to the NLO algorithm are created and shown to correct AOA measurement errors by estimating the inherent bias and time-drift in the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) of the AOA sensing platform.
